# SpaceGameControlsPrototype
A test for a control layout for an overhead 2D space flight simulator

This is heavily based on [Galak-z](http://store.steampowered.com/app/300580/) an overall excellent arcade flight game. My one frustration with it was that I constantly staffed in the wrong direction. This control layout prototype is an attempt to try out a possible solution.

## Xbox/Playstation controllers
Left Thumbstick: Controls the facing direction of the player ship.
Right Thumbstick: Controls the movement of the player ship (ship moves in the absolute direction pushed).

## Mouse and keyboard
Mouse: Controls the facing direction of the player ship.
WASD: Controls the movement of the player ship (ship moves in the absolute direction pushed).

## Tweaks
So far I like how the controls turned out. Physics is off from the game but I don't seem to move in the wrong direction unintentionally. Would have to expand out the prototype to get some more action going on so that I can get a feel for how I do in the heat of combat.

Another thought I had was to fix the camera on the player ship so that as the ship rotates the world rotates as well. Would like to try this out as well.
